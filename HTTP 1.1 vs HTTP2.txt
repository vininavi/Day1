HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP2 

•	In the ever-evolving landscape of web technologies, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) plays a crucial role in how we access and transfer data on the internet. 
•	As we have moved from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, significant changes have been made to improve performance, security, and efficiency. 

1. Connection Management

HTTP/1.1: 
   *  Each request/response cycle typically requires a separate connection. Although persistent connections (using keep-alive) allow multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, browsers often still open multiple connections to the same server to fetch resources simultaneously. This can lead to network congestion and increased latency.
HTTP/2 :

   * Allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection simultaneously. This reduces the overhead of managing multiple connections and improves the utilization of the network. As a result, page load times are faster, especially for resource-heavy websites.

2. Header Compression

HTTP/1.1
   * It can lead to large overheads, especially when many small requests are made. Each request includes the same headers, which can slow down performance.
HTTP/2
   * A header compression mechanism that reduces the size of headers significantly. By compressing headers and using a single connection, HTTP/2 minimizes the amount of data sent over the network, enhancing performance, particularly for applications with numerous small requests.

3. Server Push
HTTP/1.1
   * A server can only respond to requests that have been explicitly made by the client. This means that if a client requests a webpage, the server must wait for subsequent requests to send additional resources like images, CSS, or JavaScript.
HTTP/2
   * Introduces a feature called "server push," which allows the server to send resources to the client proactively. When a client requests a webpage, the server can anticipate the resources needed and send them without waiting for additional requests. This can significantly reduce loading times for websites.

4. Binary Protocol vs. Text Protocol
HTTP/1.1
   * It is a text-based protocol, meaning all communication is done using human-readable text. While this makes it easy to debug, it also introduces overhead due to the need for parsing and formatting.
HTTP/2
   * On the other hand, uses a binary protocol, which is more efficient for computers to parse and handle. This binary framing allows for better performance, as it reduces the complexity and overhead associated with text parsing.

5. Prioritization
HTTP/1.1
   * There is no built-in mechanism for prioritizing requests. All requests are treated equally, which can lead to issues where critical resources take longer to load if they are blocked by less important ones.
HTTP/2
   * Allows clients to assign priorities to requests, enabling the server to handle the most important resources first. This prioritization can lead to a more efficient loading process, ensuring that users see critical content as quickly as possible.

6. Security Enhancements
HTTP/1.1
  * It can support encryption through HTTPS, it is not mandated. Many sites still run on HTTP, which exposes users to security vulnerabilities.
HTTP/2
  * It is often used with HTTPS, which encrypts the data exchanged between the client and server. Although HTTP/2 can technically run over non-secure connections, major browsers only support it over HTTPS, reinforcing a more secure internet.
