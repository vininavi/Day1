JavaScript is a versatile language that uses objects as a fundamental building block. Whether you’re creating simple data structures or complex applications, understanding how objects work and their internal representation can greatly enhance your coding skills. 

What is an Object in JavaScript?

At its core, an object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys (or properties) are strings (or Symbols), while values can be of any data type, including other objects, arrays, functions, and more.

Creating Objects :

You can create objects in several ways:

Object Literal Notation:


function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
const alice = new Person("Alice", 30);
Using Object.create():

Memory Structure

JavaScript engines implement objects as hash tables or similar structures. 

This allows for fast lookups and dynamic property additions. When you create an object, it’s stored in memory, and each property corresponds to an entry in this table.

Property Keys: In JavaScript, property keys are either strings or Symbols. They are stored as references in the hash table.

Property Values: The values can be of any type, and they are stored as references to the actual data.

Object Properties

JavaScript objects can have properties that can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime. You can also define properties with specific characteristics using Object.defineProperty() or Object.defineProperties().
